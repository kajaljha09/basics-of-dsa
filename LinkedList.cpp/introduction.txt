Linked List is a collection of nodes.
Nodes have data and a pointer to next node.
In C we create Linked List using struct but in Cpp we can either create using Class or structure.
The pointer to the Linked List is created inside stack area and the Linked List is created inside Heap Area dynamically
In linked list , deletion and insertion of nodes is possible at runtime and is more flexible as there we just need to change the pointer to next node
